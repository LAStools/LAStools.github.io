  lasheight:

  This tool computes the height of each LAS point above the
  ground. This assumes that grounds points have already been
  classified (classification == 2) so they can be identified
  and used to construct a ground TIN. The ground points can
  also be in an separate file '-ground_points ground.las' or
  '-ground_points dtm.csv -parse ssxyz'.

  Should the input coordinates be in some representation where
  the z-axis does not correspond to elevation, such as in an
  earth-centered representation, then the file needs converted
  to, for example, a UTM projection first.

  The tool reads LIDAR in LAS/LAZ/ASCII format, triangulates
  the ground points into a TIN (or whatever point class(es)
  were selected with '-class 8' or '-classification 2 8'), and
  calculates the elevation of each point with respect to this
  TIN. By default the resulting heights are scaled with a factor
  of 10.0, quantized & clamped into an unsigned char between
  0 and 255, and stored in the "user data" field of each point.
  Change the default scale factor of 10.0 with '-scale_u 20.0'
  or disable the storage in the "user data" field with option
  '-do_not_store_in_user_data' or by storing the height above
  the ground as "extra bytes" with '-store_as_extra_bytes' as
  an 0.01 scaled signed two-byte short [cm resolution] or with
  '-store_precise_as_extra_bytes' as an 0.001 scaled signed
  four-byte integer [mm resolution].

  Alternatively - to avoid quantizing and clamping - you can
  '-replace_z' the elevation value of each point with the computed
  height. That means that afterwards all ground points will have
  an elevation of zero and all other points will have an elevation
  that equals their relative height above (or below) the ground TIN
  at their x and y location. In a sense this will "normalize" the
  elevations of points in respect to their surrounding ground truth.
  If you add the '-replace_z' option the resulting heights are *not*
  scaled with a factor of 10.0, quantized & clamped into an unsigned
  char between 0 and 255, and stored in the "user data" field of each
  point ... unless you add the explicit '-store_in_user_data' option.

  You can also use the height to change the point classification
  with '-classify_below -1.0 7' or '-classify_above 100.0 10' and
  also '-classify_between 0.5 2.0 3 -classify_between 2.0 5.0 4'.

  Another alternative is to use the computed height to eliminate
  points with a particular ground height above or below a threshold
  with the options '-drop_below 1.5' or '-drop_above 6.8'.

  You can ignore certain point classes from being dropped and/or
  classified with '-ignore_class 6 7'.

  If there are too few ground points to construct a ground TIN or
  the ground points form a degenerate triangulation no heights can
  be computed. By default the files are simply copied (and in case
  of '-replace_z' all elevations are zeroed). Alternatively these
  files can be skipped with the command-line option '-skip_files'.

  This tool can also be used to convert from Geoid to Ellipoidal
  heights. For this we need the Geoid model as a grid of points
  "geoid.txt", "geoid.las" or "geoid.xyz" whose elevations express
  the difference between the ellipsoid and the geoid. Simply run:

  lasheight -i lidar.las -ground_points geoid.txt -replace_z -odix _geoid

  When using external ground points with '-ground_points geoid.laz'
  lasheight will *not* use all points in the file but cut out a
  "generous portion" surrounding the bounding box of the points
  whose height is to be computed. That "generous cutting" may fail
  when the 'geoid.laz' file has sparsely spaced points. Using the
  '-all_ground_points' option forces lasheight to use all points.

****************************************************************

example usage:

>> lasheight -i *.las

computes heights for all LAS files that match '*.las' and stores
them quantized and clamped into the "user data" field (an 8-bit
unsigned char) of each point record.

>> lasheight -i *.las -class 3

the same as above but uses points with classification 3 instead
of the default 2 to create the TIN that serves as the reference
elevation against which the heights are computed.

>> lasheight -i *.laz -olaz

the same as above for LASzip-compressed input and output.

>> lasheight -i *.las -replace_z

replaces the z coordinate of each point with the computed height
to avoid quantizing and clamping their value at the expense of
losing the original z elevation values.

>> lasheight -i lidar.las -o brush.las -drop_below 1.0 -drop_above 3.0

kepps only those points who are between 1 and 3 units above the
ground.

>> lasheight -i lidar.las -o heights.txt -oparse u

stores the heights to a file called 'heights.txt' as quantized
and clamped "unsigned chars".

>> lasheight -i lidar.las -replace_z -o heights.txt -oparse z

stores the heights to a file called 'heights.txt' as floating-
point values of the same precision as the original elevations.
