The "HALL OF SHAME" is our funny-provocative and dicussion-starting way to
assure that our "open LiDAR data" is stored and distributed in our "open
LiDAR formats" to the benefits of users on any platform using any software.

clouds exclusively in closed formats such as *.sid, *.zlas, *.rar, ... 



We are taking "HALL OF SHAME" nominations ... (-;
