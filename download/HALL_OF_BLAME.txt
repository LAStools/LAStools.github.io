HALL OF BLAME
=============

The US Department of the Interior (motivated by "heroes" of the Bureau of
Land Management) has distributed memos at their affiliated agencies (such
as the USGS) that instruct their staff to uninstall LAStools claiming my 
software would present a serious security risk. More on this here:

This is a lie. This is a false allegation. When questioned by several of
my customers the federal agencies were unable to produce anything to back
up their malicious libel. No suprise. There is no security risk. Why would
there be? Why would we risk over ten years of - not only - the hard work of
creating the LAStools software but also the hard earned trust of the LiDAR
and point cloud community?

Some silly mid-level manager at BLM wanted to be a hero and created this
mess. This note will remain here until we received apology and retraction
of the defamation, slander and libel of our software, company and CEO.

Subject: [HIGH PRIORITY] LASTool Suite Presents Risk to USGS Projects and Programs

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

The USGS Computer Security Incident Response Team was informed by DOI staff
of a potential security issue with LASTools, a widely used software suite
in GIS/LIDAR communities developed by a company called Rapidlasso in Germany.
In recent days, several DOI bureaus have decided to remove this software from
their environment. At this time, USGS is not requiring removal as these tools
are used to perform critical business functions which cannot be readily replaced
with another product. However, since this situation has gained attention from
law enforcement entities, it is feared that a directive could be issued to remove
the software at some point in the future.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

Long term dependence on LASTools presents a serious risk to any USGS project or
program that relies on it. If any component of this tool suite is installed and
not needed on computers, please remove it as soon as possible. If actively used,
project managers should evaluate needs and plan a path forward which will mitigate
the risk(s) presented by this tool suite.

Please redistribute this notice to employees within your area of influence.

Thank you,

up to bullies or abusers that spread false allegations about our software
LAStools, our company rapidlasso GmbH or our CEO Dr. Martin Isenburg.
